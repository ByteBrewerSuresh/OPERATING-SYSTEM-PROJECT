<h1 align="center">IPC USING SHARED MEMORY</h1>
Inter-process communication is the way by which multiple processes can communicate with each other. Shared memory in OS, message queues, FIFO, etc. are some of the ways to achieve IPC in os. A system can have two types of processes i.e. independent or cooperating. Cooperating processes affect each other and may share data and information among themselves.

## Goal
To allow cooperating processes to access the same pieces of data concurrently and divides long tasks into smaller sub-tasks and can be executed in parallel.
